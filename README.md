## About

aurolepicker is a plugin that allows users to set their own roles from
a given list for things such as username colours, access to
semi-private channels (i.e. politics and discourse channels), or 
mentionable roles for notifications.

## Commands:

csrole: The command accessible to everyone. Uses the -j flag to join
roles, and the -q flag to leave roles. The -l flag lists all available
roles. Multiple roles can be added and removed, comma separated.

csrolemod: This command allows moderators to add roles to the list
joinable by everyone. Uses the -a flag to add roles and the -r flag to 
remove roles. Multiple roles are supported, comma separated.
